            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            <p>
                My client falls under category two: a person outside of this course.
                I am designing a website for my girlfriend, a student at Meredith College and prospective nanny.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                Client Information:
            </p>
            <ul class="half-upper-padding">
                <li class="upper-padding">Name: Zo&euml; Miller</li>
                <li class="upper-padding">Organizations: Meredith College / Zippy Zo&euml; Child Care</li>

                <li class="upper-padding">(919)-822-4064</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            <p>
                My client's web-based application falls under category one: to promote a professional project.
            </p>
            <h3>Project overview:</h3>
            <p>
                My client's web app will be designed to be used as a source of information about her nannying business.
                This will allow users to see her pricing, qualifications, and get to know her a little better through an "About Me" page.
                The intent is that users will feel more comfortable employing her nanny services if they feel like they have a better understanding of who they're hiring.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                The intended users of this web app are prospective or current customers of her nannying business.
                There will be information that pertains to both groups, allowing new customers to learn about her and her qualifications, while existing customers can see current rates and available times.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                There are a few individual pages that my client expressed interest in including. These pages are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="half-upper-padding">
                <li class="upper-padding">An "About Me" page detailing more personal information about my client. This will allow customers to get to know her, hopefully improving trust in her services.</li>
                <li class="upper-padding">A "Credentials" page that lists some of the qualifications she has for working as a nanny. This includes prior work experience with children, as well as things like a CPR License and an Abuse Prevention Certificate.</li>
                <li class="upper-padding">A "Nanny Plan" page that lists some of the activites and services that can be offered. This might include things like supervised outside time, adherance to sleeping schedule, and transportation to events.</li>
                <li class="upper-padding">A "Pricing and Availability" page that lists current hourly rate, as well as days and times she is currently available to work during the week.</li>
                <li class="upper-padding">A "Contact Me" page listing multiple forms of contact to allow parents to get in touch about questions or booking.</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>
            <h3>Page Design:</h3>
            <p>
                The "<b>About Me</b>" page will be designed to give readers an idea of who my client is.
                This will likely build trust and connection between the client and customer, as they will have an idea of who they are hiring to watch their child.
                The customer will be able to read a brief description of my client, as well as see pictures of her.
                Qualification information will not be present on this page, as that will be present in another section, instead this page is just informal "getting to know you" content.
                The user will not have to input any data into this page, it is purely for them getting to know the client, so there will be no data to validate.
                The page will include a nav bar at the top, as with any other page, and will have a slide show of pictures at the bottom of the page.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                The "<b>Credentials</b>" page will hold information on the academic and safety certifications that my client holds.
                This will likely be important to a family looking to hire her, as it includes things like a CPR certification and a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome prevention certifcate.
                Once again, the audience of this page will be parents or guardians looking to hire my client, as a way of giving them reasurrance they are hiring a trustworth nanny.
                The page will mainly consist of descriptions of different certificates or accomplishments, and links to any certificate or image relevant to that section.
                The user will not have to input any information, as this is again just an informational page.
                Readers can interact with the page though through links to different certifications.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                The "<b>Nanny Plan</b>" page will contain important content about what my client can do while caring for children.
                This will include things like the information my client has learned through a schooling in child development, that can be applied to individual child care.
                It will also offer some of the services and beliefs that my client adheres to when it comes to nannying.
                The audience will once again be customers who are looking to hire my client for her nannying services.
                No user data or interaction will be required on this page, as it is just used to hold information about my client's practices while on the job.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                The "<b>Pricing and Availability</b>" page will be used to hold information that is very important to my client's customers.
                This will include my client's current prices and pricing model, as well as the days that my client is available to be hired as a nanny.
                Text elements will make up most of the page, detailing how the pricing works and what days my client is available to work throughout the week.
                My client is interested in having a form on this page that allows users to submit data like an email address, as well as a date for when her services might be needed.
                This might require some validation, such as making sure that the submitted email address or date is valid.
                A form will be used to collect this data and should be familiar to most users.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                The "<b>Contact Me</b>" page will likely be the least involved of the 5 pages that will make up my clients website.
                This page will just hold information about how to contact my client to ask questions or to set up a date for their child to be cared for.
                The audience will again be the customer, specifically those with questions or who are looking to hire my client.
                The page will likely just be a short text outlining the ways that my client can be contacted.
                Because the page is purely informational, it won't require any user input, and no input validation.
                A hyper-link may be used to allow for quicker access to emailing the client.
            </p>
            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                There are two major dynamic elements that my client requested be implimented into their webpage.
                The first is an interactive photo slideshow on the "About Me" page.
                This would hold pictures of my client, her family, and other things that might allow a user to understand her better.
                I will structure this element similarly to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/slp/weekly-deals/top-deals?jumpid=ps_gen_nc_ns&utm_medium=ps&utm_source=ga&utm_campaign=HP-Store_US_BRA_PS_CORE_OPEX_Google_All_SEM_Exact_Core-Brand&utm_term=hp&matchtype=e&adid=529202411272&addisttype=g&cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=648319573&cq_con=41206135988&cq_term=hp&cq_med=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_plt=gp&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6UmlBEG-WlKv3S3lIoifMea5Ph04kj5q3vgP4GuHSqApoWHId71EyPhoC61gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">HP</a> storefront, in which each item can be clicked through to see multiple photos.
            </p>
            <p class="upper-padding">
                My client also requested that some sort of calender is implemented into the webpage that can hold information about available times, or allow for users to select what date's they are interested in for nannying.
                I will model this element after the schedule making systems that many businesses use to create meeting times.
                One such page is the <a target="_blank" href="https://carin.avancecare.com/carin/booking/time-selection">AvanceCare</a> website, which lets you select a date and time to recieve a medical appointment.
