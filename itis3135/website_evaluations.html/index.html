                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
                <p>For my site with a decent understanding of CRAP principles, I chose the Apple website. I figured because they are a very popular tech company, they would likely have a good understanding of what makes a website look and function well.</p>
                <ul class="indented upper-padding">
                    <li><b>C</b>ontrast: The Apple website has excellent contrast. Every image or section of text is very readable and jumps off of it's background. Sections of the page are made very clear by large blocks of differing color. None of the text fades in to any other colors or is made hard to read by its background.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>R</b>epitition: The repitition on the Apple website is also very good. The look and feel of different headers and blocks of text is very clear, giving you a sense of what a piece of text will say before you read it.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>A</b>lignment: Allignment also looks good on the Apple website. Almost all text is center alligned, but because it is almost always just one line of text, it doesn't have the usual strange ballooning effect. Products are structured into blocks, which makes allignment very easy and allows the eyes to move around the page in a natural way.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>P</b>roximity: On the Apple webpage, text and pictures are spaced out well, which keeps everything seperate, but still related. There is ocassionally an abundance of white space, but I believe it adds to the sleek look that Apple is going for.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.frankspizzainraleigh.com/" target="_blank">Frank's Pizza</a></h3>
                <p>For my site with a shaky understanding of CRAP principles, I chose the website of a pizza place near my home in Raleigh. I always have issues interacting with this website whenever ordering pizza from this establishment, so I thought it would be a decent display of some CRAP pitfalls.</p>
                <ul class="indented upper-padding">
                    <li><b>C</b>ontrast: The Frank's Pizza website has some small issues with contrast, but is generally just okay. The menu to the left of the page with labels such as "Our Menu" and "Sandwiches" can be hard to read, as the text is brown on a tan background in front of pictures of brown and tan foods.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>R</b>epition: Repitition on the Frank's Pizza webpage is not the best. It is hard to tell what a block of text will be talking about when font, text color, and background color change so frequently. There are very few clear rules for how the text appears and is structured on the page.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>A</b>lignment: The allignment of elements on the page is pretty good. Images are generally centered in the area that they occupy, and text is left alligned when it should be. A major issue I noticed was at the bottom of the page, where the address and contact information of the establishment is not left alligned, causing it to have a weird ballooned look. The menu is also not center alligned, instead being placed way too far to the right.</li>
                    <li class="upper-padding"><b>P</b>roximity: Proximity of elements on the page is also decent, but could use some work in some places. The pictures of the food on the left do not have any padding, causing them to form into one long awkward strip of pictures and text. The menu page also has some strange proximity issues. The menu leaves a large amount of whitespace all around it, as it is not correctly sized or placed.</li>
