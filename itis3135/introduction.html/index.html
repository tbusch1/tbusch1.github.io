            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><b>Personal Background: </b>I was born in Austin, Texas and lived there until I was about 8 years old. I then moved to Palo Alto, California for my moms education, this is where I feel like I “grew up”. I then moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in the summer before 8th grade. I definitely like North Carolina the most out of the places I have lived, and I intend to stay here after graduation.</p>
