            <h3>Welcome to my Introduction</h3>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born in Austin, Texas and lived there until I was about 8 years old. I then moved to Palo Alto, California for my moms education, this is where I feel like I “grew up”. I then moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in the summer before 8th grade. I definitely like North Carolina the most out of the places I have lived, and I intend to stay here after graduation.</p>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Professional Background:</b> My first and only job has been working at a place called Code Ninjas, a drop-in program where we teach kids how to code. I worked there for around 3 years. I left the job due to having to move away for college - but really enjoyed my time.</p>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Academic Background:</b> I am currently a sophomore here at UNCC, majoring in computer science with a focus on Cybersecurity - and a tentative minor in political science. I have focussed on computer science throughout high school and college, and I am always excited to learn more.</p>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I have been learning computer science through school or self-taught programs for a large portion of my life. Throughout this time I have never touched html, css, or the topic of web development in general.</p>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows</p>
            <p class="listHeader"><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="padded"><b>ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development:</b> I am interested in exploring some new subjects in computer science. I like the creative nature of web design and I am interested in learning HTML and CSS.</li>
                <li class="padded"><b>LBST2301 - Critical Thinking and Communication (RELS):</b> Besides being forced to take this class as a gen. Ed., I think that critical thinking and communication are very important for any field of work. This class focuses on critical thinking and communication as it relates to climate change - which is especially interesting and a very important subject.</li>
                <li class="padded"><b>ITSC3146 - Intro to Oper. Sys. and Networking:</b> I am taking this class because it is both very important for my major/focus, as well as it just being an interesting subject. I am not going into this class knowing much about these subjects, but I am very interested in getting some more knowledge about them</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> I used to do theater as a kid, and worked at the same children's theater where James Franco got his start.</p>
            <p class="bodyParagraph padded"><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> You should come to pickleball club this semester if you are into it or just interested in learning - I am the treasurer and we are trying to build up attendance because the club kinda fell apart last year.</p>
