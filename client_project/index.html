                    My name is Zo&euml; Elizabeth Miller, I am 20 years old, and I am a current junior at Meredith College.
                    I have lived in the Wendell/Raleigh area my entire life.
                    I am majoring in Child Development and plan on getting my K-6 licensure.
                    After graduating, I plan on teaching kindergarten through second grade as they are my favorite age.
                    Later on, I plan on going back to school for my masters to open my own child care center.

                I am the middle child of two brothers.
                My older brother is currently serving in the Navy and my younger brother is graduating highschool.
                My parents are divorced, but last year my dad was remarried, gaining me 4 step siblings.
                I am a huge family person, and the holidays are my favorite because we all come together.
                I am super close with my grandparents because they came to live with my family when we were experiencing finanical troubles.
                They both were former teachers and I believe they heavily influenced my love for teaching.

                In my free time, I love to play video games and read.
                My favorite book series is A Court of Thorns and Roses and Fourth Wing.
                You often see a book or my Kindle in hand during my free time.
                I love reading books to kids and making the stories come to life.
                I frequently play video games with my friends and boyfriend.
                I love bonding with children over video games and even playing with them.
                Video games are great for problem solving and building communication skills.
