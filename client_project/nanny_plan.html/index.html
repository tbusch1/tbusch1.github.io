            <p>
                I like to provide more than just the average babysitting service.
                I like to apply what I have learned through my child development educational career.
                I would like to work on all areas of development with each individual child.
                The main areas of development are gross motor, fine motor, speech and language, cognitive, and social and emotional. 
                I would love to take the time to talk to the parents or guardians about what activities, or areas, they would like their child to work on.
                I want to make sure each child is having fun, stress free time while their parents are away, so the activities I will  incorporate are interactive throughout day to challenge and learn.
                The best way to provide quality child care is if I get to know the family and child before I nanny for them.
                I would appreciate if each family could send me a blurb about their family, their culture, their values, and their child(ren).
                This little blurb can be sent to be via text or email that can be found in the contact section of this website.
                I want to be as culturally relevant to each individual family, and respect each member of the family.
                I made this website for new and returning families to be able to know about my life, and feel like they know the person taking care of their child a little better before letting me into their home.
